# MEMO: SEO Implementation for Curi Landing Page 2.0

**To:** Pete  
**From:** Development Team (Anik)  
**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Subject:** SEO Strategy & Implementation Plan - Guidance Requested

---

## Executive Summary

We have completed an SEO audit of the Curi Landing Page 2.0. The current site has **minimal SEO infrastructure** and requires comprehensive implementation to achieve competitive search visibility.

This memo outlines our proposed approach and specific areas where we need your guidance before proceeding.

---

## Current State Assessment

| Area | Status | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| Meta Tags | ❌ Missing description, OG tags | Poor social sharing, low CTR |
| Schema Markup | ❌ None | No rich snippets in search |
| robots.txt | ❌ Missing | Crawler confusion |
| sitemap.xml | ❌ Missing | Indexing delays |
| Core Web Vitals | ⚠️ Unknown | Potential ranking penalty |
| GEO Readiness | ❌ Not optimized | Not cited by AI (ChatGPT, Perplexity) |

**Bottom line:** The site is currently invisible to both traditional search engines and AI-powered search.

---

## Proposed Approach

We plan to use two specialist agents from our toolkit:

1. **SEO Specialist** - Technical SEO, schema markup, content optimization
2. **Performance Optimizer** - Core Web Vitals, loading speed, bundle optimization

### Implementation Phases

| Phase | Focus | Duration |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Technical SEO (robots.txt, sitemap, meta tags) | 2-3 hrs |
| 2 | Schema Markup (JSON-LD structured data) | 2-3 hrs |
| 3 | Performance (Core Web Vitals optimization) | 3-4 hrs |
| 4 | GEO (AI citation readiness) | 1-2 hrs |
| **Total** | | **9-13 hrs** |

## Questions Requiring Your Input

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We need decisions on the following before implementation:

### 1. Target Keywords
What are the primary keywords Curi should rank for?

**Options to consider:**
- "AI coaching platform"
- "Leadership coaching software"
- "Enterprise coaching tool"
- "Neurointelligent coaching"

### 2. Meta Description Copy
Should the marketing team draft this, or can we create it based on existing copy?

**Constraints:** Must be ≤160 characters, compelling, include primary keyword.

### 3. Social Sharing Image (OG Image)
Do we have an approved 1200x630px image for social sharing?

**Used when:** Links are shared on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Slack, etc.

### 4. FAQ Content
Does the content team have FAQs ready? This is valuable for both:
- Google's "People also ask" features
- AI citation (GEO) - AIs love citing Q&A content

### 5. AI Bot Policy
Should we allow all AI crawlers to access our content? This enables Curi to be cited by:

| Bot | Platform | Recommendation |
|-----|----------|----------------|
| GPTBot | ChatGPT | ✅ Allow |
| PerplexityBot | Perplexity | ✅ Allow |
| Claude-Web | Claude | ✅ Allow |

**Tradeoff:** Allowing means better AI citations; blocking means content won't be used for training.

### 6. Canonical Domain
Which is the official URL?
- `https://curi.ai/`
- `https://www.curi.ai/`

---

## Competitive Context

We recently analyzed a competitor ([askniles.ai](https://www.askniles.ai/)) and found they have:
- ✅ Complete meta tags
- ✅ Schema markup
- ✅ Optimized Core Web Vitals
- ✅ FAQ sections (GEO-ready)

To compete effectively, Curi needs parity at minimum.

---

## Resource Requirements

| Resource | Need |
|----------|------|
| Development time | 9-13 hours |
| Marketing input | Keywords, meta copy, OG image |
| Content input | FAQ content (optional for Phase 4) |
