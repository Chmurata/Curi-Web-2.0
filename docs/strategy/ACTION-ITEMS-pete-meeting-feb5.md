## Priority 1: Critical Fixes

### 1. Fix Sticky Button &amp; Spacing Issue
> *"the button isn't coming yet, the whole thing gets messed up... you can't get to the button at all"*

- [ ] Fix the section where button gets cut off on browser resize
- [ ] Ensure button is always visible regardless of scroll position
- [ ] Put button in a separate section if needed
- [ ] Test at various viewport sizes

---

### 2. Remove Scroll Pauses/Delays
> *"Every time I scroll, it should move. No pause after this."*

- [x] Remove all scroll delays between sections
- [x] Set elements to sticky with no pause
- [x] Ensure continuous scroll behavior (no "builds" between sections)
- [x] All elements should scroll together smoothly


---

### 3. Fix Bubble Animation
> *"What happened with the bubbles? They're still square."*

- [ ] Restore circular bubbles (currently appearing square)

## Priority 2: Hero Section Redesign

### 4. Bento Box Layout for Values
> *"All of this, we can design into three bento boxes"*

**Content for 3 Bento Boxes:**
1. "Say the hard thing safely"
2. "Raise accountability"  
3. "Does the part you can't scale" / "Coach in a moment"

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Make "Culture Realized" smaller
- [ ] Move content up
- [ ] Add 3 bento boxes immediately after Culture Realized
- [ ] All content (button, body, headings) should appear at **ONE time** (no staggered reveal)
- [ ] Add button below bento boxes
- [ ] **WAITING ON PETE:** Button copy for the 3 boxes

---

### 5. Phone Animation Scaling
> *"This phone should be swelling much more at the top... by the top, it's already up here"*

**Hero Phone:**
- [ ] Increase scale factor as phone scrolls up
- [ ] Top of phone should reach near the heading by end of scroll

**Second Phone Section (Performance):**
- [x] Phone needs to get bigger, faster
- [x] Should reach approximately where Pete's mouse was (near heading level)


---

## Priority 3: Section Animations

### 6. Confidence Flywheel Animation
> *"Before this one shows up, user A coaching a swelling and glow, or some sort of animation highlight"*

- [ ] Add highlight animation (swell/glow) to each item **before** it appears
- [ ] Make the whole flywheel section larger
- [ ] Ensure all boxes are **exactly the same size**
- [ ] If boxes can't match, adjust copy or add extra spacing to bottom 3

### 7. Logos/Scoreboard Animation Sequence
> *"Lonely Genius label should be there longer... much more contrast before logos appear"*

**Animation Sequence:**
1. "Lonely Genius" label appears with **high contrast**, holds longer
2. "Toolbox" appears with **high contrast**, holds longer
3. "Scoreboard" appears with **full contrast**
4. Each logo swells and returns to normal size
5. Lines start drawing between logos
6. **Dot Animation:**
   - Each logo kicks off colored dots (blue from one section, middle from another, left from third)
   - All dots converge at Curi logo
   - Curi logo does a single "ripple dance"

- [ ] Increase contrast on labels
- [ ] Extend hold time for each label
- [ ] Implement logo swell animation
- [ ] Implement line drawing animation
- [ ] Implement dot convergence animation
- [ ] Add ripple effect on Curi logo

### 8. Header Logo Animation
> *"Remove the dashes... I don't know if it's too much for the top left of the website"*

- [ ] Remove dashes from header SVG animation
- [ ] Evaluate if animation is too busy for header position
- [ ] Keep the core animation, just cleaner

---

## Priority 4: Visual Polish

### 9. Color Adjustment
> *"This guy's too orange... there's too much orange"*
