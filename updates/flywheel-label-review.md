# Flywheel Label Copy — Review & Recommendation

**Date:** Feb 11, 2026
**Re:** Proposed label updates for "The Employee Interaction Confidence Flywheel"

---

## The Challenge

The proposed new labels are significantly longer than the current ones. The flywheel diagram has **limited space per segment** (~120px wide at the label zone), and labels render at 14px inside the shaped segments. On mobile (iPhone 15), the flywheel scales down to 60% — making effective text size ~8px.

### Current vs. Proposed — Side by Side

| Step | Current (fits) | Proposed | Issue |
|------|---------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | User A Coaching | Employee 1 Receives Coaching | ✅ Fits (2 lines) |
| 2 | User B Coaching | Sends Invitation to Engage | ✅ Fits (2 lines) |
| 3 | Improved Outcomes | Employee 2 Receives Coaching | ✅ Fits (2 lines) |
| 4 | Confidence | Successful Facilitated Conversation | ⚠️ Tight (3 lines) |
| 5 | Courageous Action | Employees Insight: All Parties Receive Coaching | 🔴 Overflow (4+ lines) |
| 6 | Higher Impact Conversations | Insight Builds Confidence to Engage in Challenging Conversations | 🔴 Overflow (5+ lines) |

**Steps 5 and 6 will not fit inside the segments** — they'll either overflow into adjacent segments, overlap the center logo, or require dropping to ~9px font (unreadable, especially on mobile).

## Why Short Labels Work Better on Flywheels

- **Flywheels are glance diagrams.** Industry standard (HubSpot, Amazon) uses 2–3 word labels. The visual communicates the *cycle* — detail belongs elsewhere.
- **The swell animation fights readability.** Labels scale from 0.5× → 1.25× → 1× with a glow effect. Longer text = more visual noise during animation.
- **Mobile matters.** At 393px (iPhone 15), the flywheel is 60% size. Even current labels are borderline — longer text becomes illegible.

## Recommended Approach

**Keep labels short inside the diagram. Add detail below.**

### Condensed Labels (inside flywheel)

| Step | Condensed Label | Pete's Intent Preserved |
|------|----------------|------------------------|
| 1 | **Receive Coaching** | Employee 1 gets coached |
| 2 | **Invite to Engage** | Sends invitation to engage |
| 3 | **Peer Coaching** | Employee 2 receives coaching |
| 4 | **Facilitated Conversation** | Successful facilitated conversation |
| 5 | **Shared Insights** | All parties receive coaching insights |
| 6 | **Confident Engagement** | Confidence to engage in challenging conversations |

These preserve Pete's updated concepts (employees → peers, facilitation, engagement, shared insight) while staying **2 words each** — fitting cleanly in every segment at every screen size.

### Full Descriptions (below the flywheel)

We can add a clean numbered list below the diagram with Pete's full copy:

1. **Receive Coaching** — Employee 1 receives coaching
2. **Invite to Engage** — Sends invitation to engage
3. **Peer Coaching** — Employee 2 receives coaching
4. **Facilitated Conversation** — Successful facilitated conversation
5. **Shared Insights** — All parties receive coaching
6. **Confident Engagement** — Insight builds confidence to engage in challenging conversations

This gives visitors both the **quick visual scan** (diagram) and the **full narrative** (list below) — best of both worlds.

## Headline Update

The headline change is straightforward and fits well:

> ~~The Curi Confidence Flywheel~~
> **The Employee Interaction Confidence Flywheel**

No layout concerns here — the headline has plenty of horizontal space.

## Questions for Pete

1. **Are the condensed labels acceptable?** If not, which specific words are essential to keep inside the diagram?
2. **Do you want the full descriptions displayed below the flywheel**, or is the condensed version sufficient on its own?
3. **Any updates to the cycle order?** The current flow is 1→2→3→4→5→6→(back to 1). Does the new copy change this sequence?
